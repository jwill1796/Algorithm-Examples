# Algorithm Examples in C# and Python

Welcome to the **Algorithm Examples** repository! 🚀 This repository contains various algorithm implementations in **C#** and **Python**, providing solutions to common computer science problems.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate directories for each algorithm:

```
/insertion_sort/       # Contains insertion_sort.cs and insertion_sort.py
/bubble_sort/         # Contains bubble_sort.cs and bubble_sort.py
/selection_sort/      # Contains selection_sort.cs and selection_sort.py
/merge_sort/         # Contains merge_sort.cs and merge_sort.py
/quick_sort/         # Contains quick_sort.cs and quick_sort.py
/searching/          # Contains binary_search.cs, binary_search.py, linear_search.cs, linear_search.py
```

Each algorithm is placed inside its respective folder with both a C# and Python implementation.
